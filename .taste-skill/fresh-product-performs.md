This is the direction for this build. Adopt it. Do not blend it with the layout you would have made anyway,
and do not redraw because it is unfamiliar: unfamiliar is the point. Redraw a slot only when it conflicts
with a stated brand constraint or needs an asset that does not exist, and say why in your report.

The parts of this sheet were written separately and will disagree in small ways. Settle every disagreement in this order:
**house rules** (including type no smaller than 13px and body text of 16px or more) → **the direction** (the idea, the composition habits, where the
one accent goes) → **the type system and the palette** (which face does which job, the five size steps, which colour is the ground and where the
accent goes) → **the hero blueprint** → **the section blueprints**. Under each blueprint below, "Adjusted for this page" lists where it disagrees.
In practice: take geometry from blueprints (columns, proportions, what sits where) and take everything else from above them. Map every size a
blueprint names onto one of your five type steps instead of adding a sixth. Use one button shape, one corner radius and one pair of page margins on
the whole page, whatever individual blueprints say. If a blueprint names a kind of typeface (a light serif, a heavy grotesk), use the dealt face.

## 1. The idea
Software is most convincing when it is doing its job in front of you. Instead of describing features, put small, true, working fragments of the product on the page: the actual control, with real content, responding to the pointer. A colour picker's loupe reads the page's own background and prints its value. A list tool lets you tick an item right there. A type-scale plugin sets the page's own headings. Find the one interaction that is the product and make the hero that interaction; then show each further capability as another fragment at real size. No dashboard collage, no browser frame, no screenshots shrunk until unreadable.

Before anything else, write one sentence in your notes: "On this page, <the subject's own material> becomes <the device>."
Fill the first blank from your inventory of what only this client has (its name and what it means, its street, its numbers, its
constraint), then put the nearest competitor in the sentence: if it still works, the idea is the category's, not the client's.
Then name the one live thing the visitor can do on the page (SKILL.md step 4).

## 2. Composition
Hero: a short plain headline (4–6vw, left-aligned, upper-left third) and one sentence; the rest of the first screen is the main fragment at actual interface size, sitting directly on the page or on one flat stage colour, large enough to read every label. The fragment is built in HTML and works. Below, capabilities are a single-column sequence, each a row of two parts on a 5/7 split: a two-line statement on one side and the relevant fragment on the other, with the fragments varying in size and shape so the column never becomes a zigzag of equal blocks. Fragments are cropped pieces of interface (a menu, a row, a control, a panel edge), not whole windows. One section pins a fragment while three short statements change it.

## 3. Type — Stack Sans Headline / Stack Sans Text
A geometric sans in a light weight at large size, soft and exact at once, with its text cut underneath. Suits consumer apps, utilities and developer tools that want to feel calm and modern.

- Display: **Stack Sans Headline** — weight 300 · tracking -0.022em · leading 1.05 · sentence case; a heading may be two-tone, grey then full ink
- Text: **Stack Sans Text** — 400 for body, 500 for emphasis · leading 1.5 · tracking 0
```css
:root {
  --step-small: clamp(0.8125rem, 0.79rem + 0.1vw, 0.875rem);
  --step-body: clamp(1.0625rem, 1rem + 0.25vw, 1.1875rem);

  --step-head: clamp(2rem, 1.3rem + 3.2vw, 4rem);
}
```
The marketing type matches the product's interface type so the fragments and the page feel like one thing. Headline modest; interface text at its true size (13–15px) inside fragments.
The direction decides sizes and how many of them; the type system decides how this face is set. Where the two give different tracking or leading, use the values of the type system: they are tuned to this face.
The display size itself comes from the hero blueprint below.

## 4. Colour — Soot and lime
```css
:root {
  --bg: #0f0f0f;
  --surface: #1a1a1a;
  --ink: #ffffff;
  --muted: #8f8f8f;
  --accent: #dafa9c;
  --accent-ink: #0f0f0f;
  --field-1: #ffffff;  --field-1-ink: #0f0f0f;
  --field-2: #dafa9c;  --field-2-ink: #0f0f0f;
}
```
A soot-black opening and close bracket white middle sections, all in black, white and grey. Pale lime is the single action colour: every button, and at most one headline set in it on the dark ground.
Neutral ground. The product's own interface colours provide the colour. At most one flat stage colour behind fragments.

## 5. Imagery
**The project has no photographs of its own yet.** First choice: **real pictures of the subject's world from the open collections**: its city and street in old postcards and photographs, an old map of the neighbourhood, its materials up close, its trade in engravings, museum objects of its kind (references/imagery.md §3). Start with `node C:/Users/Martin/.agents/skills/design-taste-frontend/scripts/assets.mjs "contenido muestra"`, then queries from your inventory (its street, its materials, its trade's tools and history). Download what you use into the project with `--get` and credit every one on the page (`--credits` prints the footer line). They show the world around the client, never the client's own room, dish, product, person or team. Second, for what no honest picture exists of: draw the subject's own things in code, large, in one flat graphic language and the palette's real colours (its tiles, its windows, its objects; references/imagery.md §8). Third: the dealt photographs, only where an honestly generic picture fits (the sea, the weather, a material), never one a visitor could take for the thing itself and never an unrelated scene. One treatment for all of them. If this direction is built on photographs, plan the set before building (four to six pictures of one family) and reuse them at different crops and scales instead of finding or drawing a new picture for every slot; keep drawings as `<symbol>` + `<use>` or generate them with a small script so the page stays light. List every found picture (with its source and licence), every dealt photograph and every drawing that stands in for photography in your report.

The interface fragments are the main imagery: build them carefully with real labels, real numbers and sensible states (one hovered, one selected). Around them, two or three real pictures of the customer's world (found with scripts/assets.mjs), never stock of people at laptops.

**Floor (the inspector checks it):** at least four real pictures on the page, usually six to twelve; SVG drawings do not count. One moving picture where an honest clip exists: `node <skill>/scripts/assets.mjs --video "<query>"`, used as a muted loop with a poster frame. Whatever this direction says about pictures, it is carried out with real ones.

Photographs dealt for this build, from the "Architecture" set (structure, lines, bridges, facades and building interiors)
Order of preference for imagery: (1) the project's own photographs and product shots; (2) images you generate, if an image tool is
available; (3) real pictures of the subject's world found in the open collections (assets.mjs, downloaded and credited on the page);
(4) drawings of the subject in code; (5) these. They are real photographs (Unsplash licence, served by picsum.photos) of places, light and
texture. They are atmosphere, never a stand-in for a specific product, dish, person or interface. List the ones you use in your report so
they can be replaced.

The last two path numbers are width and height: request the exact crop you render (`/1200/1500` for a 4:5 portrait, `/2400/1350` for a hero) and
add `?grayscale` to desaturate. Use three to six of them, not all eight. Always set `width`, `height`, `alt` and `loading="lazy"` (not on the hero image).
Other sets that fit this brief: fog-and-quiet, object-still, hands-and-making, people — `node draw.mjs --photos <set>` prints one in full; `--photos list` shows all sets. Taking photographs from another set is your call and is not a redraw; keep them to one light and one treatment.

## 6. Hero — Control that reads the page
A near-black or deep neutral ground split into two halves by tone alone: the right half is one step lighter than the left, and they meet at a clean vertical edge at 50%. Left half: a small logo mark top-left at a 40px margin, then two-thirds of empty ground, then everything else anchored bottom-left, 40px from the edges: a one-line headline at clamp(26px, 2.1vw, 32px) in medium weight, one supporting sentence at 17px in the softer ink held to 44ch, and the single action as a light rectangular button. Right half: one fragment of the product, centred, about 450px square, built in HTML and working. It is the product's defining control (a loupe, a picker, a dial, a field) and it acts on the page itself: it reads the real background colour, the real headline size or the pointer position and prints that value in its own readout at 13px. Mark its root with data-ui so the product's own radii and borders apply inside it. There is no navigation bar; one text link sits top-right at 15px.

On a phone: The halves stack as two tones. The fragment comes first: 78vw square, centred in the lighter block, which is 58svh tall, still live and reading the page under the visitor's finger. The darker block below holds the headline at 6.4vw on up to two lines, the sentence at 16px and the button, left-aligned at 20px. The logo mark sits top-left over the first block.
Headline: One plain line at 26–32px naming what the tool is, up to about 32 characters, wrapping to two lines on a phone.

Adjusted for this page:
- It names colours (black): map them onto this palette's roles (ground `--bg`, panels `--surface` and the fields, text `--ink`/`--muted`, the accent `--accent` on the primary action only).
- It draws lines or borders: keep them only inside a table, a form or a `data-ui` fragment; elsewhere separate with space or a change of ground.

## 7. Sections, in order
Each is a composition to rebuild with this project's content. Keep the geometry; change the subject. Re-order or drop a
section when the argument of the page needs it (see references/copy.md), never to fall back to a card grid.

### 1. work — Quiet ledger, side preview (list)
A plain ledger in one column 560px wide whose left edge sits at 22% of the viewport width. A heading of two or three words at 24–28px in medium weight, then 32px of space, then one row per project, 44px tall: the name at 16px in full ink at the left, the kind of work at 14px in the soft ink starting at 55% of the column, and the year right-aligned with tabular figures. Nothing is drawn between rows; the three fixed starts make the columns. Hovering or focusing a row keeps it in full ink, drops the others to the soft ink, and shows that project's image in the empty area right of the column: a 4:3 frame 300px wide, `position: absolute`, its top aligned to the hovered row, 64px from the column's right edge, appearing with a 150ms fade. Holds 6–20 rows; group by year with 28px of extra space.
On a phone: The column fills the width with 20px margins. Rows are 52px tall: name at the left, year at the right, kind of work on a second line at 13px. There is no hover preview; instead the first three projects each show a 16:10 image at full column width above their row.

### 2. about — Founder's letter (stack)
A letter in a centred column 520px wide with at least 160px of empty ground above and below. At the column's top-left, a round portrait 44px across. 28px below it, four or five short paragraphs at 16–17px with leading 1.55, each two to four lines and separated by one blank line, written in the first person. No heading. The sign-off is the writer's name at 22px in the text face's italic, with the role at 14px in the soft ink beneath it. One phrase in the letter may carry a flat marker-colour background. Variant for a page built as an object: the letter sits on a filled paper-colour sheet 640px wide with 60px padding on a contrasting ground, square corners, its bottom edge cut into small scallops with `clip-path`, and below a row of 5px round dots a tear-off strip 72px tall that carries the email address.
On a phone: The column takes the full width with 24px margins; text at 16px, portrait 40px. In the sheet variant the sheet spans edge to edge with 24px padding and keeps its shaped bottom edge; the tear-off strip stacks the email above a full-width button.

Adjusted for this page:
- It names a kind of typeface: use the dealt faces (display Stack Sans Headline, text Stack Sans Text) and their settings; capitals only where the type system sets them.

### 3. contact — One field, nothing else (stack)
The whole section is one prompt and one field in a column 520px wide, on the page's text column line or centred, with 200px of empty ground above and 160px below. The prompt is two lines at one size, 24–28px in medium weight: the first line in the soft ink, the second in full ink. 28px below, a single input 520px wide and 64px tall with a 12px radius, filled with the lightest tone on the page so it is the only bright surface in view; no outline at rest and a 2px inner ring in the accent on focus. Inside the right end of the field, 8px from its edge, a round submit button 44px across with an arrow and an accessible name. 16px below the field, one line at 13px says what happens next. 72px lower, three label and value rows at 14px: email, phone, address.
On a phone: The column fills the width with 20px margins. Prompt at 22px. The field stays one row, 60px tall, with the arrow button inside its right end. The three label and value rows stack with the label above each value and 20px between them.

Adjusted for this page:
- It names its own corners: use the one radius of this page (square unless the direction says otherwise) and one button shape.

## 8. Motion — Masked headline
On load, each line of the headline rises from behind its own baseline, about 900ms with a strong ease-out, the second line 110ms after the first; the supporting sentence and the action then fade up together. Nothing else on the page performs. Because headlines are two lines at most, you author the line breaks and wrap each line yourself. Recipe: 'Masked line reveal' in references/motion.md.
This is the signature move, the one loud moment. Around it the page still needs the rest of the motion layer (SKILL.md step 9): an entrance for the parts of every section, feedback on every control, and one moving picture. The inspector fails a page that barely moves. Recipes: references/motion.md.

## 9. Where the richness comes from
Fidelity. A fragment with believable content and a real hover state is more interesting than any illustration. Spend the effort there.

## 10. How this direction goes wrong
A fake interface made of grey bars and circles is the worst outcome; if you cannot build a believable fragment, change direction. Mark each fragment's root element with the attribute data-ui: inside it the product's own conventions apply (1px control borders, small radii, a shadow on its open menu) and the inspector leaves them alone; outside it the house rules hold as usual. data-ui is for cropped fragments only, never for a page wrapper. Do not put the fragment in a browser or laptop frame.

## 11. Real references
Studied sites that work this way. Take the principle, never the specifics: no names, copy, images or signature assets of theirs.
- **Shelf** (One Page Love, studied score 7.1) `opl-shelf`
  Idea: Saves scattered across a dozen places are funnelled into one searchable shelf, shown literally by tumbling source chips and a panel edge that narrows to a point.
  Hero: An off-white panel sits inside a 12px warm-grey page frame. A compact floating nav about 880px wide: logo left, three links and a lime waitlist button right. Centred stack: a small grey pill badge with a sparkle icon, then a two-line headline in General Sans Semibold at about 5.8vw with tight tracking, one word of which sits on a lime rounded-rectangle highlight; a two-line grey subhead; an email field with its button nested inside one rounded outline, 460px wide. From 75% down, the top of a bordered app window rises, and a larger search bar holding a half-typed query overlaps it with a soft shadow.
  Worth taking: Shape a section's bottom edge into a chevron and run a hairline from its tip to the next heading, turning 'many into one' into layout.
- **Rows** (One Page Love, studied score 7.5) `opl-rows`
  Idea: Radical understatement: a product about simple lists is sold with a 27px headline, 12px copy and a column of small live demos, each proving one interaction.
  Hero: Warm off-white page, almost empty. Everything hangs on one vertical line 27% in from the left. A small striped-letter logo mark sits there near the top; 220px lower comes a two-line headline at only 27px (under 2vw), then three lines of 13px body about 370px wide, then a near-black rectangular button with 4px corners beside a text link with an arrow. A single grey sign-in link sits in the top-right corner; there is no navigation bar. More than 80% of the viewport is blank. At the bottom edge the first feature module peeks in: grey demo panel left, short text column right.
  Worth taking: Set the headline at near-body size (under 2vw) and let empty space, not scale, give it importance.
- **bleibtgleich’26** (Awwwards Site of the Day, studied score 7.5) `aww-bleibtgleich26`
  Idea: One thin vertical rule runs down the page and a tight bold grotesk sentence wraps around it, words stepping from one side of the line to the other.
  Hero: White page, black type. Content sits in a narrow band between 26% and 68% of the width. A 1px vertical rule drops from the top edge at 37% for two-thirds of the height. Left of it: a black blob avatar at the top, a tiny role caption at its foot. Right of it: a tiny location note at the top, the name in two lines of 90px medium grotesk at the bottom. The tagline continues below at the same size, flush to the band's left edge, running past the fold. The upper half is otherwise blank. The handle is split into two pale-grey words fixed in the bottom corners; a black menu pill sits top-right.
  Worth taking: Draw one 1px vertical rule and typeset a large sentence around it, alternating words to either side so the line becomes the text's spine.
Full notes on any of them: `node draw.mjs --site <id>`.

## Always
Headlines two lines or fewer at every width. No eyebrow labels, no monospace, no 01/02/03, no thin rules, no gradients, no shadows at rest,
no cream-and-terracotta, no violet. `inspect.mjs` measures all of it.
